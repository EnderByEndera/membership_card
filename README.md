## Attention
Please notify that when you want to deliver your code to this repo, please push to dev branch, DO NOT TO MASTER!!! This is of vital importance that we need to keep master branch clean.

When you want to develop a new feature, please firstly create your branch LOCALLY, then do some fixes and merge to your LOCAL dev branch, then push to online dev branch. If your push is rejected, it must be because someone update the online dev branch. What you need to do is to pull the dev branch and then solve the conflicts locally, at last, push to online dev branch. This can solve problem.

Remember, when you merge your code to local dev branch, don't forget to write comments including what feature you want to add and what code you want to revise. DON'T FORGET IT!!!!!!

If some bugs appeared, please create a hotfix branch locally and then solve the bug locally and then merge to dev or master branch locally. Then push to repository at last.

Please don't forget to read this README!!!!! For the clean and tidy repo, you have to read me!!!!
